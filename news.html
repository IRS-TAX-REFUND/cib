                <h6>August 1, 2014</h6>
                <p>Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) were established in 2003 so that individuals covered by high-deductible health plans could receive tax-preferred treatment of money saved for medical expenses.  Generally, an adult who is covered by a high-deductible health plan (and has no other first-dollar coverage) may establish an HSA.  Health Savings Accounts differ from Flex Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs).  They are owned by the individual and funds roll over year to year if not spent.  HSAs may currently be used to pay for qualified medical expenses.</p>
                <p>According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the number of businesses offering HSAs has risen dramatically recently.  For more information visit:  <a class="alertexit" href="http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/benefits/articles/pages/hsas-outpacing-hras.aspx">http://www.shrm.org </a></p>
                <p>As a business owner, a high deductible health plan may be right for your company.  Health Savings Accounts can be a great addition to your company’s benefit package as they can be a good way for you and your employees to supplement that higher deductible.</p>
                <p>As an individual participating in a high deductible health plan, whether you are planning ahead to pay for unexpected medical expenses or strategizing to offset your high deductible, a HSA could help you save money.</p>
