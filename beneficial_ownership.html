							<h1>Beneficial Ownership</h1>
							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>In May 2016, the U.S. government passed a new regulation regarding the beneficial ownership of legal entity customers. Going forward, it will be mandatory for all financial institutions to comply with this regulation by identifying the ultimate beneficial owner(s) and a controlling person of a legal entity customer opening or maintaining an account.</p>
							<p>In compliance with this new regulation, Cental Illinois Bank will collect beneficial ownership information from legal entity customers starting in the first quarter of 2018. This means that any time an account is opened or maintained for a legal entity, we will request information that identifies the ultimate beneficial owner(s) and controlling person of the legal entity. The required identifying information includes name, address, date of birth, identification number, and other information that will help identify those individuals. This information will need to be collected whether or not the person identified is a Cental Illinois Bank client. This information will also be collected for existing legal entity customers who establish or maintain accounts once this new regulation is implemented at Cental Illinois Bank in the first quarter of 2018.</p>
							<p>While we understand the information requested is personal and sensitive, we need to obtain this information in order to comply with the law. As always, we will treat all information collected with the utmost care. All information will be stored securely and handled with the same standard of privacy that we have always maintained.</p>

											<p>The U.S. government regulation defines “beneficial ownership” as being made up of two roles: (1) those that have an ownership interest in a legal entity and (2) those that control a legal entity.</p>
											<p>For those people who have an ownership interest in the legal entity, Cental Illinois Bank is required to identify and collect personal information on anyone that meets or exceeds the following ownership thresholds: </p>
											<p><u><i>Ultimate Beneficial Owners:</i></u></p>
											<p>A natural person having 25 percent or more of the equity interests of a legal entity; or</p>
											<p>A natural person owning more than 10 percent if:</p>
											<ol type="a">
												<li>An individual, with any amount of ownership, is a non-U.S. person (i.e., a non-U.S. citize who is not a lawful permanent resident); or</li>
												<li>The entity customer or intermediary entity is formed outside of the U.S.; or </li>
												<li>The entity client is a Private Investment Companies (PICs) / Personal Investment Vehicles(PIVs).</li>
											</ol>
											<p><u><i>Control Person</i></u></p>
											<p>A person with significant managerial control or influence over a legal entity customer (e.g., Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Managing Member, General Partner, etc.)</p>
											<p>For every legal entity client subject to beneficial ownership, you must identify one control person.</p>
											<p>NOTE: It is possible that the control person may also be an ultimate beneficial owner.</p>
