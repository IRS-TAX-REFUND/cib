							<h1>Beneficial Ownership</h1>
							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>In May 2016, the U.S. government passed a new regulation regarding the beneficial ownership of legal entity customers. Going forward, it will be mandatory for all financial institutions to comply with this regulation by identifying the ultimate beneficial owner(s) and a controlling person of a legal entity customer opening or maintaining an account.</p>
							<p>In compliance with this new regulation, First Republic will collect beneficial ownership information from legal entity customers starting in the first quarter of 2018. This means that any time an account is opened or maintained for a legal entity, we will request information that identifies the ultimate beneficial owner(s) and controlling person of the legal entity. The required identifying information includes name, address, date of birth, identification number, and other information that will help identify those individuals. This information will need to be collected whether or not the person identified is a First Republic client. This information will also be collected for existing legal entity customers who establish or maintain accounts once this new regulation is implemented at First Republic in the first quarter of 2018.</p>
							<p>While we understand the information requested is personal and sensitive, we need to obtain this information in order to comply with the law. As always, we will treat all information collected with the utmost care. All information will be stored securely and handled with the same standard of privacy that we have always maintained.</p>
